## Student Debates at the International Congress of Entomology

Pushing past all the nervousness in starting a blog, here we go!

*"What function does this serve?"* As I sat through the second round of rebuttals, I became utterly distracted by a nagging feeling that this isn't what I, or my fellow students, should be doing. Here we were, sitting on stage justifying why one solution trumped all others. The entirety of my graduate research to date has focused on how real-world complexity complicates deployment of any new technology designed to control pests. Insects don't behave in the wild the same as in the lab. There is never a silver bullet technology to solve it all. Regional differences in culture and environment have major roles in which control methods are used. Successful pest management is a combination of methods optimized for a specific place and time, yet we vehemently argued our technology was superior to all Is debate perpetuating antiquated approaches to problem solving? 

**Has formal debate outlived its usefulness?**

The theme of the 2016 International Congress of Entomology centered on 'Entomology without borders' and the grand challenges the world faces, namely sustainable agriculture, invasive species, and the pathogens transmitted by insects, such as dengue fever and malaria.

The audience question portion solidified this notion, whereby the majority of questions centered on ways to incorporate the
 Last week the International Congress of Entomology was co-located with the Entomological Society of America's annual meeting in Orlando, FL. For the second year in a row, I participated in the Student Debates, representing North Carolina State University. This year, we chose to defend why lethal gene modification of *Aedes aegypti* was the best technology to decrease the incidence of dengue fever worldwide. Our formidable opponents were from Purdue University, defending Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes as the superior technology.

Same as the previous year, I chose to develop and deliver our team's presentation of our main argument. Here, we argue why our side is the best, and why the opposing team's choice is lacking.

I don't think anyone on that stage
