I am a doctoral student at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I research the development of sustainable control solutions for invasive insect pests in agricultural systems. I'm also interested in exploring the ethical and social issues surrounding genome editing technologies, specifically with regards to genetically modified insects.  

## Current Interests and Projects:

* Complexity theory
* Behavioral manipulation
* Science communication
* Science policy
